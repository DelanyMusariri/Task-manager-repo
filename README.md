Introduction

Hi there, and welcome to my tracker app!

This is the project I’m most proud of so far in my programming journey. It was my final project for a six-month bootcamp, where I applied everything I had learned—from debugging and problem-solving to writing clean and efficient code. Working with databases, especially SQLite, was an exciting challenge that made managing information faster and easier.

The bootcamp gave me a glimpse into the real-world tech environment, where we had to build projects with specific requirements and deadlines. Time management was crucial, as unexpected challenges arose, but with the help of a mentor, I was able to complete the project successfully.

About the Project

This program is designed for individuals who want to monitor their finances. It allows users to track their expenses, income, and budgeting using Python and SQLite.

functions:
Add and track expenses and income,
Set and monitor financial goals and 
View and manage financial data efficiently

How to Run the Program

Open a code editor like VS Code.
Copy the contents of the tracker file and save it as a Python file.
Run the Python file. The database will be created in the same directory.
Once the program starts, you will see a menu with options to view, add, or set financial goals.

Final Thoughts

I’m incredibly proud of how far I’ve come—from my first print statement to building a task manager and now this finance tracker, all in just six months! This project demonstrates my progress in coding, efficiency, and adaptability. I hope it showcases my ability to learn, create, and improve continuously.
